# Initial Visualisations - download speed by region
```{r viz1, echo = FALSE, out.width = "90%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/regional_download_speed.png")
```
---

# Initial Visualisations - download speed by regional income
```{r viz2, echo = FALSE, out.width = "90%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/gdhi_download_speed.png")
```
